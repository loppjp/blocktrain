# Descision Log

1. Focus on Training Pipeline and prioritization

Per stakeholder input to "Design an ML pipeline", emphasis for this project will be to design a ML training pipeline using a given dataset and target test cases. 

### Priorities

#### High

- Design artifacts for a CV ML training pipeline.
    - At this time, CV and ML are inferred based on context
- Design artifacts supporting training pipeline development using the Request for Discussion (RFD) Format.
- Publication of source code, RFD on public facing Github.
- Model inference using the test set videos.
- Generation of model weights using one or both training datasets.
- Considerations for the expected sensor and updates to documents and code to support considerations.

#### Medium

- Documentation of code
- Training Metrics
- Exploratory data analysis notebooks
